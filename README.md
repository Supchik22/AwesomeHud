# AwesomeHud
AwesomeHUD is a simple client-side Minecraft mod that enhances the player's user interface by providing essential information at a glance. This mod aims to improve the overall gaming experience by displaying a compass, a clock, and armor information directly on the screen, without requiring the player to possess these items in their inventory.

# Features:

## Compass:
AwesomeHUD includes a compass that is constantly visible on the screen, allowing players to easily orient themselves and find their way in the vast Minecraft world. This feature is especially useful for navigation, ensuring that players never lose their sense of direction.

## Clock:
The mod also features a clock, displaying the current in-game time. This helps players manage their activities effectively, such as knowing when it's time to seek shelter from hostile mobs or to embark on nighttime adventures.

## Armor Display:
AwesomeHUD provides a visual representation of the armor worn by the player. It shows the condition of each armor piece, allowing players to assess their protection level at a glance. This feature assists in deciding when it's time to repair or replace armor.

Additional Information:

No Inventory Requirement: Unlike in the vanilla game, players do not need to have a compass, clock, or armor pieces in their inventory for AwesomeHUD to function. The information is conveniently displayed on the screen at all times.
